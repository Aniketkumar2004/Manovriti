Project Vision:
Mental health care is often expensive, slow, and disconnected from real-world experiences. MindMesh envisions a world where anyone can access affordable, stigma-free support through a seamless blend of AI, peer guidance, and professional therapy.
Solution OverView:
AnonMind is a decentralized platform that:
1.Uses an AI chatbot to assess user needs and provide initial support.
2.Connects users to peer mentors with lived experience for empathetic guidance.
3.Escalates severe cases to licensed therapists for professional care.
4.Leverages machine learning to match users with mentors/therapists and improve via feedback.
By combining AI and human expertise, AnonMind delivers personalized, scalable mental health support.
Problem Statement
1.Traditional therapy is costly (avg. $100-$200/session) and inaccessible for many.
2.People hesitate to open up to professionals due to stigma or lack of relatability.
3.Existing platforms lack anonymous, peer-driven guidance from those who’ve overcome similar mental health challenges.
4.Centralized systems risk data breaches and erode trust in mental health support.

Features:
*AI-Powered Chatbot:
1.Uses NLP to understand user emotions and issues (e.g., anxiety, stress).
2.Offers basic coping strategies and escalates serious cases.
*Peer-to-Peer Guidance:
1.Anonymous mentors with verified lived experiences provide relatable advice.
2.Secure, encrypted communication for trust and privacy.
*Therapist Integration:
1.Direct access to licensed professionals for intensive therapy.
2.Seamless transition from mentors to therapists based on need.
*Smart Matching:

*Anonymity & Security:
1.End-to-end encryption and decentralized data storage.

Flow:
1.User Interaction: Users access the platform via web/mobile, starting with the AI chatbot.
2.AI Assessment: Chatbot uses NLP to analyze issues and suggest next steps (self-help, mentor, or therapist).
3.Matching: ML algorithms match users to mentors/therapists based on issue severity and preferences.
4.Mentor/Therapist Support: Secure chat/video sessions with mentors or therapists.
5.DAO Governance: Users stake tokens to vote on platform policies (e.g., mentor vetting rules).
6.Data Handling: Anonymized data stored on IPFS; feedback improves AI and matching.

Tech Stack:
1.Frontend: React.js, React Native (mobile), Tailwind CSS
2.Backend: Node.js, Express, Flask (for AI endpoints)
3.AI/ML: TensorFlow, Hugging Face (NLP), Scikit-learn (matching)
4.Storage: IPFS (decentralized), MongoDB (metadata), AES-256 encryption
5.DevOps: Docker, AWS/GCP, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
6.APIs: Twilio (chat/video), OpenAI (optional NLP enhancement)
Usage:
*Onboarding:
1.Sign up anonymously via email.
2.Interact with the AI chatbot to describe your concerns.
*Support Flow:
